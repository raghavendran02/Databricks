1.By Querying files find out:
	1. Get the Total records while querying the files of yellow trip data
	2. Get the count of passenger > 1 while querying files of yellow trip data
	3.In May green trip file how many trips has distance greater than 5 miles
	4. Get the PaymentID for "disputed" payment type
	5. Total number of passengers travelled in green taxi which are captured only in the csv files
2. Create a CSV non-delta table for green trip dataset, by inferring schema
3. Create a CSV non-delta table for green trip dataset, manually specifying the schema
4. create a json delta table for payment types dataset
5. create a managed delta table by querying the json file payment types
6. create a managed delta table for green trip csv dataset using read_files
7. create a managed delta table for ratecodes using a csv non delta table
8. create an external delta table for green trip csv using read_files
9. create an external delta table by querying the taxiZones dataset
10. find how many parquet files in the delta table yellowtrip_parsed_delta, otpimize it based on vendorID. how many files does it result in?
----------------------------------------------
views:
1. create a csv non delta table for green trip dataset
2. use 1 to create a temp view for all passengers with passenger_count >0, trip_distance >0, fare_amout > 0.0, pick up and drop location is not null
3. use 2 to find out:
	1. count of passengers where pickup and drop is in year 2019
	2. total fare amount
	3. Month wise total passengers
	4. Avg trip distance for every vendor
	5. total fare amount for every payment type
4. create a global temp view for taxi zones dataset and create a delta table from that view
5. create a view of payment types dataset and create an external delta table from that view
6. create a CTE to calculate the time travelled in hours for green trip dataset(use 1. for this) and find out total time in hours travelled for every vendor
